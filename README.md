TinderView
========

Created A Simple and Beautiful Tinder like card deck & Captain Train like toolbar.

This is heavily based on [AndroidSwipeableCardStack](https://github.com/wenchaojiang/AndroidSwipeableCardStack), wenchaojiang has written the library very well but i faced a lot of difficulty integrating it & that's the reason i built this app so that you dont waste time. Use this repo as a base for your app & build on top :).

API 16 and UP. (Support for API 16 is now live thanks to [#4] (https://github.com/GadgetCheck/TinderView/pull/4)) 

In Action

The demo is now available, dont forget to give it 5 stats if it helped you. Oh if you can contribute to development of the library in anyway i would love to see your pull request. 

Happy Coding!
